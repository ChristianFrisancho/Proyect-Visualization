# Welcome to the future. Welcome to **iSea**

Your future main data visualization library is **already here**. **iSea** provides an interactive dashboard and analytical toolkit  for exploring the global transition to electric mobility. Using a series of coordinated visualizations, this platform allows you to move seamlessly from a high-level geographic overview to deep, data-driven explanations.

### What You Can Do Here

**Our goal is to help you answer key questions about the EV transition such as:**

-   **Where** is EV adoption and charging infrastructure strongest?
-   **How** do different countries compare on transition pressure and infrastructure readiness?
-   **Why** do specific patterns exist?

To achieve this, the project is structured around our core visualizations and tutorials.
